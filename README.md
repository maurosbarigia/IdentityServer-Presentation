# RemarkerTemplate

- edit the markdown in slides.md
- `---` is the slide separator, `???` is the notes separator
- other markdown is fairly self-explanatory
- styles in-lined in index.html
- push up your changes to your repo (which you've setup as a GitHub pages site) to see your changes as you edit
- or run a local web-server pointing to your local copy
